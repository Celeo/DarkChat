<h1>DarkChat Documentation</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
	<b>DarkChat</b> was created to solve the shortcomings of HeroChat, which DarkTide used for over a year. As I remember, HeroChat was not correctly letting the 
	Admins set permissions to channels, nor letting us correctly set channel mods. In addition, I do not believe that it, at the time, it allowed for any sensible way for 
	players to purchase their own in-game channels, as the plugin's command system was disfunctional and manually editing its configuration was not sensible.
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
	<b>DarkChat</b> is a fully-featured chat overhaul, including full permissions configuration to multiple channels, full resistriction including mutes, kicks, and bans, 
	varied channels with colors, a sensible and simple command system, logging on command and per channel/player, and private messaging. As with all of the Dark* 
	plugins, it was developed to be used in upholding rules and easily as possible.
</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>
	<u>Hard</u>:<br>
	1. <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/bpermissions/">bPermissions</a><br>
	<u>Soft</u>:<br>
	1. <b>DarkClans</b>
</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
	When the plugin is ran for the first time, it will copy its default configuration out from the plugin .jar file into the appropriate directory. This configuration comes 
	pre-packaged with 9 channels, defaulting to interfacing with <b>DarkClans</b> for faction integration. All configuration editing can be done with the in-game 
	commands, but <b>DarkChat</b> does support manual editing and reloading with the appropriate command.
</p>

<h2>Commands and Permissions</h2>
<p>
	All basic commands are started with any one of the following labels:<br>
	1. <b>ch</b><br>
	2. <b>dc</b><br>
	3. <b>darkchat</b><br>
	Then, the parameters are as such, with their matching permissions:

<h2>Changes Needed Prior to Use</h2>
<p>
	- Code regarding players sending tells to Celeo needs to be removed.<br>
	- Check dependency on DarkClans.<br>
